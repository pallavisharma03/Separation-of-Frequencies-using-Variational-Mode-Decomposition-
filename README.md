**Separation of Frequencies using Variational Mode Decomposition**

In many fields of science and engineering, signal analysis and decomposition are essential procedures. The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique for the decomposition and analysis of complex signals is the main focus of this project. In order to create a composite signal, the script first generates three sinusoidal signals using user-supplied frequencies. These signals are then combined with random noise. The composite signal is then subjected to the VMD algorithm, which breaks it down into its individual modes. A different frequency component from the original signal is represented by each mode. These modes are then transformed into audio format so that each component can be heard individually. The script also has the ability to plot the modes, allowing for optional visual analysis. In addition, the centre frequencies of the modes are calculated and shown via frequency analysis, which sheds light on the original signal's frequency composition.

This project is meant to be used as a teaching tool for concepts related to signal processing, specifically as they relate to decomposition techniques. Through interactive exploration and manipulation of signal components, users can enhance their comprehension of signal characteristics and their interpretations. This project's real-world implementation of VMD demonstrates how effective it is at breaking down complex signals, a useful skill in a variety of domains including biomedical signal processing, vibration analysis, and audio processing. This project advances research and practical applications in related fields by offering a hands-on approach to signal decomposition and analysis. It also broadens the understanding and utilisation of signal processing techniques across disciplines.
